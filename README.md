# F-repo
Hi there, I'm Raghed, a computer science student. I'm involved in the full stack role, and that's why I'm learning both the backend (PHP and Laravel) and the frontend (Bootstrap and React). This is my first repository, and here I'll make a weekly update on my learning journey. I intend to master Laravel over the coming months before switching to React to build full-stack applications.

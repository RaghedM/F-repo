# F-laravel
This is a mini-project that helped me learn how to connect to a database using Laravel and do the  CRUD operations on the database. The important webpages are (Create) and (Computers )and the rest can cantain what ever you want, so I kept them with no important info. #local host I'm using XAMPP as web server that canitans the Apache HTTP Server, and MySQL database.
